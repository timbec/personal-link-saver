# Personal Link Server


Full Stack JS app allowing users to save, tag and share links. 

Built with React on the front end and Mongo DB on the back end, 
and Express.js as the server. 

The reason for this app? There are many apps that allow you to save links in one way or another. However, for whatever reason, 
I don't like any of them. So I decided to build my own. It was a good way to learn React. 

Like many people, I have far too many links open on my browser at one time. Then I lose links. I don't like using Bookmarks - 
they get tangled and confusing very quickly. I want a quick way to save and organize links, without cluttering up my 
browser. Later, I'd like to develop a feature to add multiple users, and for users to share links internally. I would also 
like to find a way to scrape crucial data from each page - particularly recipes, which I use a lot - to know what is contained
in each link at a quick glance. 

I also want to blog and how I built at least some aspects of this app, like using the Context API.
